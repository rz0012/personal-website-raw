Graduation speech for the students of graduating in 2012 in Computer Engineering in my university, Santiago de Compostela. After graduating in 2007 and having started a company since then, I got the chance to participate in the graduation ceremomy with a speech.

Maybe the best thing is that I thought that the "inspirational quote" that I used to close the speech was from Steve Jobs - as I had seen attributed in Wikiquote. But it turned to be a joke added to the page - where the quote itself is from a Digimon son ğŸ¤· ([Butter-Fly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter-Fly), in particular).
