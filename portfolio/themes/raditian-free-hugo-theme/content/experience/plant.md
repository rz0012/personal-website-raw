### Fine-grained visual classification of plant species in the wild: Object detection as a reinforced means of attention

#### Description 
Plant species identification in the wild is a difficult problem in part due to the high variability of the input data, but also because of complications induced by the long-tail effects of the datasets distribution. Inspired by the most recent fine-grained visual classification approaches which are based on attention to mitigate the effects of data variability, we explore the idea of using object detection as a form of attention. We introduce a bottom-up approach based on detecting plant organs and fusing the predictions of a variable number of organ-based species classifiers. We also curate a new dataset with a long-tail distribution for evaluating plant organ detection and organ-based species identification, which is publicly available.

- Developed a fine-grained visual classification technique for the classification of 1000 plant species  with [Matthew Keaton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-keaton/). It was used on five plant organs: leaf, flower, fruit, bark, and high-density leaves. The work has been published at CVPRW, 2021. 
- The preliminary work was presented at the WVU 3rd, 2020, the Undergraduate Research Day at the Capitol (URDC),
2021, and the National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR), 2021.
