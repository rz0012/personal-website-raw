  title: About Me
  content: '
    <p class="lead">
    My current area of focus is studying literature on biological systems, specifically, the underlying principles behind adaptability in ever changing environment. 
    Understanding this will give us insights into building more robust artificial systems, potentially AGI systems. 
    </p>
    
    <p class="lead">
    Beyond that, I enjoy cooking, hiking, camping, reading, writing poems and science fiction, and listening to podcasts related to the Advancement of Human Civilization.
